How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

with knowing the difference between version of a file, I know where has been modified and anrrow my search scope to the diff part.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

Will in case I've made a mistake, I can find the right version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

auto save cant tell you the version, which means you cant start from some points of  previous work

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

google Docs is focused on doc editing and saving,which means you should open a file before saving it.
git focused on files management, which means it will record the changes and submit to the server.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log shows the file history git diff shows diffs between curr file and current version

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

any changes I've made can be reversed.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Code version controll, manage my markdown files.
